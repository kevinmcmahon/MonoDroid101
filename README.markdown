.Net? MonoDroid Does
====================

Example code and slides used in the MonoDroid presentations given by [Kevin McMahon](http://blog.kevfoo.com).

The code has been adapted to work in MonoDroid Preview 10.

The layout and the localization examples are from the Android tutorial examples and the bar code example is from the Chicago Android workshops.

Some of the example code are based off the Android tutorials provided at the [Android Developer website](http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/index.html).  Those works were created and shared by the Android Open Source Project and have used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution License.
